# Vigenère cipher decoder and encoder
## Python terminal-like interface for user to decode and encode a message
The program uses Vigenère cipher algorithm to encode or decode a charactor-based message using a given key.
Vigenère cipher is a simple and special case of Polyalphabetic Cipher.
For a quick understranding, check this youtube video [Polyalphabetic Cipher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgFJD7oCmDE).
The program is not entirely accomplished with the following known flaws:
- Unable to reject an numeric or alphanumeric string
- Unable to reject an numeric or alphanumeric key
